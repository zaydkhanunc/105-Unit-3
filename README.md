# The Impact of Unemployment and Median Household Income on General Health


**The following repository was created for Professor Gotzlers English 105 class in the fall of 2024 at the University of North Carolina.**

The repository contains a raw data csv file, and a modified subset of that data as a .csv file. 

It also contains a python notebook that provides detailed instructions on how to create the modified data subset. 

## Purpose of Repository:

The purpose of this repository is to highlight the impact of socioeconomic factors such as Unemployment and Median Household Income on General Health.

The impact of general health is measured by 3 indicators.

* Premature deaths
* Adult Obesity
* Poor Mental Health Days
  
The following data housed in the repository could be used by public health and public professionals, but may also be used by students or people with an interest in the socioeconomic determinants of health. 


## Where did this data/code come from?
The data was provided by Professor Gotzler on Canvas and is available on the web. The raw data titled CountyHealthData_2014-2015.csv can also be found in the online repository. 

As for the code, I wrote it myself and referenced the pandas1, pandas2, and python_basic notebooks provided by Professor Gotzler. 

## What can this data be used for?

* Firstly, the data can be used by public health organisation to propose legislation and policies that tackle these economic inequalities so that community health may improve across the board

* Data analysts may employ the dataset to decipher hidden patterns and generate visualisations that highlight the relationship between socioeconomic factors and health indicators.

* Academic institutions, primarily schools and universities may use this dataset in their curriculum to teach students how to work with real world data, and derive proper insights from the data.
