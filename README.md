# 105-Unit-3-Creating a Repository on Github

The following is a repository that contains a sample dataset on County Public Health, and then contains a python notebook with detailed instructions and code on how to create a new susbset of that data.
The python notebook contains a guideline that is easy to follow and created for people with little to no experince with python and Google Colabs. 

Provenance (where did this data/code come from)
The dataset called CountyPublicHealth2014-2015, is available online and was provided to me by Professor Gotzler.
I wrote the code myself and referenced the the pandas1, pandas2, and python_basic notebooks provided by Professor Gotzler. 

Purpose:
This data is for County Public Heallth, and the notebook contains instructions on how to create a subset of the data that focuses on how unemployment and median household income impact general health. 

Potential:
This repository was created to provide a streamlined, and reproducible workflow for analyzing public health data. It aims to enable professionals, students, and people with little coding experience to peform data analysis without complex setups.
